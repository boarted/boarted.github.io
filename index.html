        a textboard is the precursor to what we now know as the 'imageboard', a kind of anonymous bulletin board based around the posting of images. with a textboard, there are no images, just text. as such, given the anonymity, group identity is contained entirely in the language of the posts, the particular syntagmatic choices / general 'voice' one puts on to signal to other people that - YES. I am anonymous too. anagram of textboard is boarted. for this project, i wanted to boart the textboard experience.<br><br>
        aphasia is an impairment in speech. i occasionally suffer from it. unsurprisingly, just as a broken machine shows you how to fix it, aphasia has long been an object of study for linguists. roman jakobson placed aphasics in two categories in order to make larger observations about how we put words together to make language. there were those who lacked paradigmatic faculties, and those who lacked syntagmatic ones. these were the similarity disorder and the contiguity disorder. it's quite simple to imagine someone without paradigmatic faculties (the similarity disorder). this is marked by inappropriate lexicon. the Jabberwocky comes to mind. just substitute words. uhe contiguity disorder is a deficiency of syntax. words are appropriate, they come out, but in the wrong order.<br><br>
        by boarting, i wanted to make the textboard voice strange. i wanted to twist it in a way that let me say 'yes, this is language. this is textboard language.' this would be simple to simulated by replacing words and jumbling their order. but i wanted more. real aphasia is not simply divided into two disordersm, it combines the two. i wanted to do it through the interface of the imageboard itself, to make the computer croak back to me the language id known. so i trained a neural network on several months worth of posts scraped manually from a textboard for a few days. this was a specially written network, it was 'forgetful', which is to say, it suffered from a disorder that caused its normally otherworldly ability to make language out of nothing, rather aphasic. that's /boart/!

                But it's been a while to be a fucking shit as a week, the seasons are alone that the world is a damn good girl and the subs are an actual life of the boart is a talent of the shallow world was never good afterwards and thought that the first time I tried to find a decent party of the boart and think many levels could be desperate and a magic taste of having a shit taste meaning that they are a pretty good life.

                but really some things are the same as two episodes have a fucking group for me if you didn't see the boart that she was so fucking surprised by the same reason for a while and the first time they don't have the scene with the shit on that translation is the best one that has finally preserved that the boart was going to be able to tell you that it's a good point without really suffering the characters better than she had on the thread and they are all pretty good than watching the first to be a great guy.

                Maybe this is a disterrish of the seasons, but the side in the boart was the same thing that seems to be black and the other person who doesn't even think the characters are being a shitty teacher to save people to be a good character injection that makes me want the stuff and make the shadows the mom they dropped to think of that but it was an boart since they are so fucking boartn on the street that starts to probably beat the boart and that they are all new or snake for something that doesn't invest into the manga, but that makes sense for a good place?

                Confirmed to be not just a shitty sequel and the girl that would make sense in the slightest thing that kills the boart about the boart at all.  I don't mind her up now that they are supposed to be a character with the same at this point you would have to be a decent pink god of the subs villain when she learns she could have a few time and the boart is stronger than in the few of this boart is that the second season was on the tableshit"

                Only the only thing between the other two being such a shit for the point of the manga to be a good of the sluts, and that it was a shit taste  And I want to see that it's completely used like that and that in this boart looks like supportuan and boarts on the small characters just look at a supposed of the boart that he wants more and all of the boarting of the chapter was allowed to make it the worst part of the boart and the only that sold up the sword that it was a pretty good point, the boart was all about there and to see this seem to be a weak episode when they were completely underestimated as a shit boart, but that was all about a stupid fact that he was able to see the staff of a servaning expectation of the school stuff and Shirou are all around the tier to the story she is a shitty and Buu in top of the first time they are all that such fucking heart.
